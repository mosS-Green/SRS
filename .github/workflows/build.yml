    # User requested to use gradle directly, avoiding wrapper permissions issue
    # But we usually typically need to setup gradle if not using wrapper to ensure version match
    # GitHub runners have gradle installed.
    # "Grants execute permissions to gradlew" was in the list but "Use gradle directly" was the override.
    # I will skip gradlew chmod and use `gradle` command.
